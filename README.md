# Damage_Vision_project          Machine Learning Project
*A Machine Learning & Deep Learning Project*

This project is part of my ongoing **learning journey in Machine Learning and Deep Learning**.  
I am developing it in parallel with the **Deep Learning Specialization by deeplearning.ai**, applying each concept as I learn it and watching the project evolve step by step.

## Project Goal  
To build models that can analyze building images and estimate the **level of structural damage**, such as:

- No damage  
- Minor damage  
- Partial destruction  
- Severe destruction  

The long-term aim is to create a practical tool that can support **post-war assessment and reconstruction efforts in Gaza**, helping communities rebuild safely and efficiently.


## Why This Project Matters  
Gaza is emerging from one of the most destructive periods in its history.  
A reliable, automated, affordable damage-assessment system can help:

- Speed up inspection of damaged homes  
- Support prioritization for reconstruction  
- Provide consistent, data-driven assessments  
- Reduce the need for dangerous on-site evaluations

Damage\_Vision
==============

**Machine Learning & Deep Learning Project**

Project Overview
----------------

**Damage\_Vision** aims to build machine learning models that analyze images of buildings and estimate the level of structural damage.

The long-term vision is to classify damage into multiple levels, such as:

*   No damage
    
*   Minor damage
    
*   Partial destruction
    
*   Severe destruction
    

However, the project is being developed **incrementally**.

### Current Stage (Initial Version)

As a starting point, the project focuses on a **binary image classification task**:

*   **Destroyed**
    
*   **Not destroyed**
    

This allows me to build a solid foundation, validate the data pipeline, and apply core deep learning concepts before moving to more detailed damage estimation (e.g., multi-class classification or percentage-based damage assessment).

Learning-Driven Development
---------------------------

This project is part of my ongoing learning journey in **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**.

I am developing it in parallel with the **Deep Learning Specialization by deeplearning.ai**, applying each concept as I learn it — from data preparation and model design to training, evaluation, and optimization.As my knowledge grows, the project evolves step by step in complexity and capability.

Why This Project Matters
------------------------

Gaza is emerging from one of the most destructive periods in its history.Assessing structural damage manually is time-consuming, costly, and often dangerous.

A reliable, automated, and affordable damage-assessment system can help:

*   Speed up the inspection of damaged buildings
    
*   Support prioritization for reconstruction efforts
    
*   Provide consistent, data-driven assessments
    
*   Reduce the need for risky on-site evaluations
    

The long-term goal is to contribute, even in a small way, to safer and more efficient post-war recovery and rebuilding.
